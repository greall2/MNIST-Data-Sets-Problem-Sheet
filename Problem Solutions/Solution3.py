#3. Output the image files as PNGs
# Use Python to output the image files as PNGs, saving them in a subfolder in your repository.
# Name the images in the format train-XXXXX-Y.png or test-XXXXX-Y.png where XXXXX is the image number (where it occurs in the data file) and Y is its label. For instance, the five-thousandth training image is labelled 2, so its file name should be train-04999-2.png. 
# Note the images are indexed from 0, so the five-thousandth image is indexed as 4999. See below for an example of it. Commit these image files to GitHub.hash symbol.
