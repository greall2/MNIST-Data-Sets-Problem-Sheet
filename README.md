# 1. Read the data files

Download the image and label files. Have Python decompress and read them byte by byte into appropriate data structures in memory.

# 2. Output an image to the console
Output the third image in the training set to the console. Do this by representing any pixel value less than 128 as a full stop and any other pixel value as a hash symbol.

# 3. Output the image files as PNGs
Use Python to output the image files as PNGs, saving them in a subfolder in your repository. Name the images in the format train-XXXXX-Y.png or test-XXXXX-Y.png where XXXXX is the image number (where it occurs in the data file) and Y is its label. For instance, the five-thousandth training image is labelled 2, so its file name should be train-04999-2.png. Note the images are indexed from 0, so the five-thousandth image is indexed as 4999. See below for an example of it. Commit these image files to GitHub.
